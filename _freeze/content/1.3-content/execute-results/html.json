None of these writers was self-consciously “an economist” or saw themselves as writing “about econonomics,”^[We won't see anything like this until the 19^th^ century.] but it is pretty clear they occasionally touch on economic subjects.\n\nWhile I have not assigned any Plato to you^[Mainly because it is not in our *Reader*!], you should familiarize yourself briefly with Plato's more famous claims and view of \"the ideal State.\" \n\nA note of caution in reading Plato: Plato was the student of the famous Socrates (who did not write anything down), and he writes in dialogues, often between his Socrates character and other famous Greek contemporaries.\n\nAristotle - who was Plato's greatest student - writes often in opposition to Plato's views. Thus, it is useful to know what Aristotle is referring to. \n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n### Required Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Part I (Pre-classical Thought) Introduction, Aristotle, *Politics* & *Nicomachean Ethics* in Medema & Samuels (*Reader*)\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Ch.2 (Early Preclassical Economic Thought) in Landreth & Colander\n\nBlaug unfortunately does not cover anything before mercantilism & the physiocrats.\n\n### Recommended Readings:\n\nThe following Wikipedia entries can also provide more background on these writers and their famous works:\n\n- [<i class=\"fab fa-wikipedia-w\"></i> Liberty of Ancients Compared with that of Moderns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberty_of_Ancients_Compared_with_that_of_Moderns)\n- [<i class=\"fab fa-wikipedia-w\"></i> Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato)\n- [<i class=\"fab fa-wikipedia-w\"></i> Plato's *Republic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato))\n- [<i class=\"fab fa-wikipedia-w\"></i> Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)\n- [<i class=\"fab fa-wikipedia-w\"></i> Aristotle's *Politics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_(Aristotle))\n\n### Questions to Help Your Reading\n\n- How much of these writings are meant to be normative vs. positive? \n- What economic concepts or principles can you find in these writings?\n- What can we glean of Aristotle's method or methodology? How does he approach the subjects he writes about and get us to learn something from them?\n- What is the State, according to Aristotle? What are its origins and purpose? What is the relationship between the State and an individual?\n- What does Aristotle have to say about property? What about property held \"in common\" versus \"private\" property?\n- What the role of \"equality\" or \"reciprocality\" in exchange?\n- What is the purpose, origin, and nature of money?\n- What aspects of \"the art of wealth-getting\" are \"natural\" and what are \"unnatural?\"\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
