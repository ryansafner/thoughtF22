One suggestion would be to take a discussion question that you turned in or found interesting from the readings and lectures as a jumping off point.\nIf you truly want to be efficient, I would consider writing about the theme of your longer term paper, focusing on the idea in this era that we have discussed so far (and do a later era of that theme for your 2nd short paper)!\n\nA lot of mercantilist tropes and policy ideas remain popular today (“Buy American,” our country needs to to “win at trade”,”tariffs protect American workers,” obsessions over the balance of trade and fixing trade deficits, etc.). Why do you think this remains popular in the minds of the people and/or political leaders? Why do you think some such policies are still in existance?\nHow much does “the Ricardian vice” still persist among economists who focus on abstract theoretical models with simplifying assumptions at the potential expense of real world evidence? Is this a fair or unfair characterization?\nEnding mercantilism is simple, in theory: get rid of trade barriers, monopoly privileges, and other restrictions. Why is it so hard? And in particular, should we encourage developing countries to do this?\nHow did Europe escape feudalism? Is Adam Smith’s narrative in Book III of the Weath of Nations convicing? What remnants of feudal ideas, institutions, and customs remain today?\nWhat are the major similarities and differences between Hume and Smith’s theories of moral sentiments? How do they compare to other moral theories (like Kantian deontology or utilitarianism and consequentialism)? What do you find convincing or unconvincing?\nGrapple with Das Adam Smith problem: is there consistency or inconsistency between Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations?\nHow much of Ricardo’s theoretical system was influenced by the Corn Laws? Do you think Ricardo would have gone about his model differently if there were not policies raising Corn prices and rents at the time?\nWhile they clearly agreed agriculture experienced diminishing returns, the classical economists more vaguely thought manufacturing did not (perhaps it was constant returns, perhaps it was increasing returns). How might they have made a Smithean division-of-labor argument defending increasing returns to manufacturing (or to the economy in general)?\nWhat is “capital” to the classical economists, and how does that comport with what we think about “capital” in economics today? What is the difference between “profit” and “interest”, between “capitalist” and “entrepreneur?”\nThe classicals, the physiocrats, and Marxists clearly believed that some labor is productive, and some labor is unproductive. Why did they think this, why did these groups have such different targets for “unproductive” labor, and do you think this distinction is still valid today?\nIn what way are Ricardian rents and Ricardo’s theory of rent connected with what we call “rent-seeking” behavior in modern economics?\nWhat do you make of the debate over Say’s law between Ricardo, the Mills, Say, and Malthus? Was there a clear winner and loser?\nRicardo used a highly simplified model of the economy as firm in his Corn model to the distribution of income and consequences of economic growth. In what way is this similar to modern macroeconomic models of the steady state?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "“How can I know what I think until I see what I say?” — E. M. Forster on Writing\n\n\nOverview\nYour task is to write a term paper on a theme in the history of economic thought. You should either focus on one idea, concept, or issue and trace its evolution from pre-classical to modern economic writings on the subject (while critically appraising the trajectory), or you may analyze a particular era or debate that you find interesting. In committing to either path, you should engage the key texts from the famous writers that constitute our readings, as well as some outside readings and research to provide further analysis and ground your arguments.\nAlthough it is only a sample size of 1, I suggest you look at my term paper from my undergraduate history of economic thought course as an example of the latter type of paper (focusing primarily on the debate between Malthus/Keynes and Ricardo/Say, so two primary time periods):\n\n Safner (2010), “The Duality of Say’s Law: A Restoration of J.B. Say’s Original Intentions”\n\nRather than a series of exams, a term paper in a 400-level seminar course pushes you to grapple with the famous writings and controversies of the economics profession, serving as part of your capstone in economics. This is also my way of gauging whether you understand the material and are attempting to grapple with the challenges it brings to understanding economics. Second, it is a chance for you to stimulate and develop your own thinking on some of the issues raised in this course, as well as an opportunity to develop your writing and communication skills. These skills are vital to any profession, and in truth, you do not fully understand an idea unless you engage it in writing.\nI am NOT looking for a survey of existing research, a series of block quotes showing what economists have said about \\(x\\), a regurgitation of my lectures, a list of pros and cons with a last minute conclusion, a book review, and so on. I also do NOT want you to compress everything you have learned so far into a single paper. You should only use those insights that you believe are relevant to your topic and your argument.\nI am looking for a paper that is your own take on a topic, and one that puts forth an argument and defends it, in the context of the history of economic thought.\n\n\nLength, References, & Mechanics\nAs a 400-level term paper, I expect approximately \\(\\mathbf{15 \\pm 5}\\) pages (the usual double-spaced, size 12 font, 1 inch margins). You will need space to develop your arguments, place the readings in context, and connect it with modern research on the topic.\nYou should cite the texts of the authors we have read (if useful, you can cite them as chapters in the Warren and Samuels Reader). Be aware that the excerpts of the works contained in the reader may not be the only thing the author has written about that will be relevant to your topic. Thus, it will often be necessary to find full copies of some of the necessary works. Fortunately, most of the famous books (Smith, Ricardo, Malthus, Marx, Marshall, etc) can be found free online, at websites like the Library of Economics and Liberty, Liberty Fund, or Project Gutenberg. You should not have to buy additional books for this paper.\nI would also like you to use scholarly references, that is, articles from economics journals and cite them properly. I do not have a minimum requirement of the amount of references, but I expect you to have at least 3-5, depending on your paper topic and thesis.\nI am not particularly picky about exactly how you format your citations or bibliography, just please be consistent, and do not use footnotes or endnotes for references (only because I find them annoying). I suggest the APA author-year-page in-text citation format that is fairly standard in economics journals, i.e.: “The division of labor is limited by the extent of the market,” (Smith 1776: 27).\nLook at my slides or my handouts for a suggested bibliography style. If you use .bib files, the default formatting is fine.\n\n\nGrading Rubric and Deadlines\nThis paper is due by email to me by 11:59 PM Sunday November 22. Afterwards, I will deduct 1 point for every hour it is late.\nWhile it may be possible for many papers in your college career (and worked for me), this not a paper you can easily write in the last minute and do well on. To ensure that you do not get too far behind, I have split the assignment into stages that are due at different intervals over the semester. Note that your topic can and may change depending on what you are able to find and work with.\nI highly, highly suggest that you strategically use the short paper assignments as waypoints for this term paper. In other words, write your short paper 1 about what the Classical economists thought about your theme, and write short paper 2 about what the Neoclassical economists thought about your theme.\nHere is the rubric that I will use to grade your paper:\n\n\n\nCategory\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nSoundness\n35\n\n\nPersuasiveness\n35\n\n\nClarity\n10\n\n\nOrganization\n10\n\n\nReferences/Quotes\n10\n\n\nTOTAL\n100\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Soundness: Does your topic have economic content relevant to the history of economic thought? Do you accurately describe the opinions of previous economic writiers? If applicable, do you properly apply modern economic theory? Are your explanations consistent and logical, and did you apply them correctly? Did you choose relevant (and non-cherry picked) evidence to back it up? Are your facts, data, or case studies accurate (if appropriate)?\nPersuasiveness: How persuasive is your argument? Would a reasonably educated college-level reader find themselves understanding and agreeing with you? [Write for an audience wider than just members of this class. Therefore, don’t use terms, sources, or “inside jokes” that only your classmates in this class (and no one else) would understand.] Remember, your goal is not to convince me (though you may), your goal is to convince any educated reader, and I grade you the probability that this is likely. You are the lawyer, I am the judge, and your audience is the jury.\nClarity: How clear is your paper? Is it clear what your thesis is, focusing on a particular theme, and providing a relevant narrative?\nOrganization: Is your paper organized? Have you presented your separate arguments/examples in a logical order? Is it clear when you are moving on from one section to another? Is it clear when and where you are summarizing and concluding?\nReferences/Quotes: Do you engage with what the writers we discuss had to say? Do you represent their views correctly? Do you have quotes from the readings that can back up your point? Do you cite scholarly works interpretting or analyzing the works we have read? Do you give proper attribution and use a consistent citation practice?\n\n\n\nA Few Suggested Themes\nHere are a few themes that you might consider tracing the evolution of writing on:\n\nModels of market competition (must it be “perfect”?, normative vs. positive views of competition)\nIncome or wealth (in)equality (by sex, race, class, etc.)\nThe environment\nMonopolies and competition policy/antitrust\nIncreasing returns1\nInnovation, innovation policy, intellectual property rights2\nEconomics of sex/gender, women’s rights\nSlavery, racism, eugenics\nRationality vs. irrationality\nRole of institutions vs. pure homo-economicus\nSocialism as an alternative to markets/capitalism\nProper role of government\nEconomic growth\nMoral (un)desirability of economic growth, consumerism\nHarmony vs. conflict in society\nMethodology in economics\n\nUse of formal mathematics in theory\nInductive vs. deductive reasoning\nTheory vs. econometrics & empirical work\n\n\nNote that some may require some additional outside research, and modern readings to supplement what the early writers discussed (or did not discuss).\n\nSome Titles of Previous Student Papers\n\nThe Idea of Economic Success Throughout History\nUsury and Interest in Ancient Greece, Rome, Judaism, and Early Christianity\nAltruism in Economics\nRevisiting the Efficiency of Slavery\nEconomic Growth and Changes Due to Economic Theory\nDivision of Labor Across Centuries: A Building Block of Modern Economies and Societies\nThe History of International Trade: The Free Trade Debate\nThe Evolution of the Importance of Land in Economics\nCommunal v Private Property: The Debate Through Economic History\n\nAgain, you can also see my undergraduate term paper (from 2010) for my undergraduate HET class. Note this is not the paper I would write (or necessarily fully agree with) today.\n\n Safner (2010), “The Duality of Say’s Law: A Restoration of J.B. Say’s Original Intentions”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nI’m writing a paper on the history of this now.↩︎\nThis sounds like another good paper I’d write if I had time!↩︎"

There are a lot of well-develoepd writings from a lot of well-known thinkers of this era. Since we will not be lingering long, there is a lot of reading in a short amount of time. Thus, it’s most important that you read the secondary textbook, and in the Reader, read the biographies of Mun, Petty, and Mandeville, and then skim each of their writings to get a feel for what they are interested in and how they discuss it."

    "section": " Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nWe begin with a deep dive to a major point of departure in the Western liberal political philosophy canon. Thomas Hobbes is often invoked as the first explicit originator of the a social contract theory of the State. Writing during the English Civil War - the ultimate result of which would set the Western world on a path towards liberal democracy, constitutional republics, and the industrial revolution - Hobbes is famous for his bleak view of the state of nature (a hypothetical society without government). He is often noted as a supporter of a strong State, whom he saw as an absolute monarch, as the solution to this problem. Hobbes is often written off quickly in political philosophy, as a predecessor to the more celebrated John Locke, the clear inspiration fo the U.S. Declaration of Independence and many modern ideas. However, Hobbes provides both deep analytical insight to the nature of the problem (which can be recast in modern game theory terms), as well as a clear break from Ancient political philosophy. We will read selections from Hobbes’ famous 1651 book, Leviathan.\nThe famous counterweight/improvement to Hobbes’ 1651 Leviathan is John Locke’s 1689 Second Treatise on Government. Both Locke and Hobbes consider the State as a social contract rational individuals construct to escape the state of nature. In contrast to Hobbes, Locke sees humanity as far more sociable in the state of nature, able to make cooperative agreements, discover, and apply “the laws of nature.” Yet, creating a civil government improves on what he sees as the three “inconveniences” of anarchy. Most importantly, Locke famously arguers that the ultimate aim of the State is to protect individual property rights."

Any educated person should read Smith, and, if you are interested in economics, you should read as much Smith as you can get your hands on. Everything is there (in some form).\nToday we will focus primarily on understanding the system of the Classical Economics (so a bit of foreshadowing), as well as Smith’s refutation of mercantilism and physiocracy. As such, in addition to Smith, I will be quoting from Hume and Bastiat regarding their views on mercantilism (see recommended readings below). The quotes from Hume we have already seen.\nThe reading for Smith comes primarily from Book IV: Of the Systems of Political Oeconomy. These sections are in your Reader (p.165-179). I will also be quoting form Book III when describing the emergence of commercial society out of feudal society. You can find all of The Wealth of Nations online for free here:\n\n Wealth of Nations (Online)\n\nNext class we will dive into more of Smith’s analytical insights and the analysis of markets, prices, and economic growth. See the associated readings from WON for next class.\n\n\nRecommended Readings:\nWeingast discusses Adam Smith’s Book III on the economic history of Europe in the context of his views on economic development:\n\n Weingast (2016) - “Adam Smith’s Theory of Violence and the Political-Economics of Development”\n\nBelow are the readings from Bastiat that I quote. I also make everyone in ECON 306 read (or at least I discuss) Bastiat’s broken window parable in “What is Seen and Not Seen”\n\n Bastiat (1845) “The Candlemakers Petition”\n Bastiat (1850) “The Balance of Trade”\n Bastiat, 1848 “What is Seen and Not Seen”, (Section 1)\n\nAs I mentioned in class, you might find How the Dismal Science Got its Name insightful and surprising. It is a 6 part series of blog posts based on research by David Levy & Sandra Peart. - Part I - Part II - Part III - Part IV - Part V - Part VI\nThe following Wikipedia entries can also provide more background on these writers and their famous works:\n\n Adam Smith\n The Wealth of Nations\n\n\n\nQuestions to Help Your Reading\nBook III\n\nHow did Europe escape feudalism and emerge a “commercial society”?\n\nBook IV\n\nWhat does Smith say about the goal of mercantilism?\nWhat does Smith say is the goal of all economic activity?\nWhat does Smith say about the “balance of trade” doctrine?\nWhat does Smith think of Quesnay and the physiocrats?\nWhat is the “obvious and simple system of natural liberty?” What duties does Smith believe the government has? ##  Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.

Your reader focuses primarily on Book I and the division of labor (pp.156-165), which is great, but sadly lacks selections on capital from Book II or public finance from Book V.\nIt is a good idea whenever you can, to read as much of Books I1 and II as you can.

    "section": " Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nToday we begin looking at some major competing approaches to economics during the late 19th century into the Progressive Era of the early 20th century. These both serve as alternatives and criticisms of neoclassical economics of the Marshallian and the Walrasian variety.\nWe start in Central Europe with the German Historical School, who viewed economics as having no special status or claims to universality beyond the study of history and the particular circumstances of different times and places. They famously got into a conflict with Carl Menger, the Austrian marginalist (who himself was no fan of the Classical School), over this methodological issue. Before this, we consider one “predecessor” to the Historical approach, an important writer on international trade and development (because his views are a direct contrast to Smith and the Classical approach), Friedrich List. His work The National System of Political Economy is considered the “Bible of protectionism.”\nTheir influence extended to the United States via the Institutionalist approach to economics, which we consider next. We first discuss the Progressive Era and the rising attitudes towards maximizing social efficiency, rationalizing society along scientific basis, and using the State through administrative agencies to intervene in markets to accomplish these ends. We end with a focus on one of the most famous American critic of neoclassical economics (he himself coined the term as the object of his ire) — Thorstein Veblen."

    "section": " Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nOne of the implications of neoclassical economics is that we have discovered all of the optimal conditions — in production, in consumption, and in exchange — for maximizing the value of resources for society. Markets and a market-based economy have lots of problems but we know the optimal results they can achieve. So, since economists have discovered the optimal conditions for resource allocation, why can’t the government just replace the market to efficiently allocate resources? It will achieve the same results as a market equilibrium, and arguably for the better, since it can avoid the problems with markets!\nThis claim, coupled with the fact that in the late 1910s a major European power undergoes a revolution where the victors try to establish a socialist society, constitutes the focus of the “socialist calculation debate.” How would a socialist economy and society actually operate?

Buchanan, 1964, “What Should Economists Do?”\nThe History of Economic Thought explores the development of economic principles and tools and the major economic thinkers to explain why the discipline and practice of economics looks the way it does today. By studying principles and intermediate micro- and macro-economics, you may get the impression that economics is a complete system of agreed-upon scientific laws to be applied individuals or the economy for understanding and recommending policy. This course will strip away that belief and get you to see that what is accepted as mainstream economics both has evolved considerably over the past 250 years and continues to be contested to this day. While there is much consensus, there continues to be much debate as to what economics is, what it is about, what are the best methods to study it, what are the policy implications, and what does it tell us about the world. The best way to understand these debates and to take a position is to understand the history of economic thought: how ideas of various thinkers and schools of thought were slowly incorporated into the mainstream of economics, marginalized as heterodox, or completely discarded; and how this process has changed many times.\nWe will read famous texts by the major thinkers - Smith, Ricardo, Malthus, Marx, Mill, Keynes - explore the key insights and development of concepts and models from different schools of thought - mercantilist, classical, Marxist, neoclassical, Austrian, institutional, Keynesian, New- and Post-Keynesian, etc - and place developments and ideas into historical context. As a one-semester course, we must inevitably leave out many major thinkers, ideas, and debates in the history of economic thought. If you have a particular interest that we do not cover, consider this an ideal topic for a research paper.\nMuch of this course will examine the history of how modern economic doctrine evolved, and this assumes that you have familiarity with modern economic theory at the intermediate level. As such, the prerequisites for this course are ECON 305 - Macroeconomic Analysis and ECON 306 - Microeconomic Analysis.\nAs a 400-level course required for all economics majors, this course is intended to be an upper-level seminar to enrich your understanding of economics beyond the theoretical tools you have already learned. This implies a significant amount of reading, writing, and discussing, on your part, requiring you to take ownership of your own learning. Against my strong instincts to lecture, this class will primarily be discussion-based and focused heavily on required readings for each meeting."

    "text": "Books\nOur readings are of two types: (1) primary sources - the famous texts of the writers themselves; and (2) a secondary textbook that will help you interpret the primary sources and place them in the broader context of their day and in the evolution of economic thought.\nPrimary Sources:\n\nMedema, Steven G and Warren J Samuels, eds., 2013, The History of Economic Thought: A Reader, 2nd ed., New York: Routledge\n\nSecondary Textbook:\nYou must purchase a secondary textbook, but I will give you an option to choose one. I will be drawing from both books in my lectures.\n\nLandreth, Harry and David C Colander, 2002, History of Economic Thought, 4th ed., Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company\nBlaug, Mark, 1996, Economic Theory in Retrospect, 5th ed., New York: Cambridge University Press\n\nI intended on requiring Landreth and Colander (2002), but I was sad to find that it is out of print. As such, I was unable to get it via Hood’s bookstore. There should be used copies on Amazon for a somewhat reasonable price (it has been fluctuating between $20-$100). I strongly recommend this book because it is easier to read, focuses more on historical context and big ideas than getting lost in the math/models, and has more robust coverage of different schools of thought (including heterodox) and extends right up to the present day.\nBlaug (1996) is also an excellent book, but is a bit more advanced, focusing on fewer thinkers, and focusing in detail on their contributions to modern economic theory (i.e. models and math) with very little discussion of historical context. I would say get Blaug only if you are unable to get Landreth and Colander for a reasonable price (or at all).\nDo not purchase both books!"

Some assignments may require in-class participation for credit, and an (unexcused) absence may be detrimental to your grade. Attending class is one of the strongest predictors of success.\nHowever, as required under Hood College’s “Promise of Fall Plan,” (Ch. 2-C) your classroom attendance will be recorded at every class meeting. This is primarily to facilitate contact tracing.\nIf you know you will be absent, you are not required to let me know, but it is polite to give notice (Note if I do not reply to an email of yours letting me know, I am probably busy but will still see it and appreciate your email). Your absence will be noted and recorded for the purposes stated above. If, however, we have an assignment due in class, you must notify me ahead of time in order to make alternate arrangements to still receive credit.

Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only after the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy.\nPapers: Starting at the deadline, I will take off 1 point for every hour that your assignment is late.\nI reserve the right to re-weight assignments for students whom I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment."
