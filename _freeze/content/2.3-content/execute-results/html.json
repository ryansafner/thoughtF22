The reading for Smith comes primarily from Book I: *Of the Causes of Improvement in the productive Powers of Labour* and Book II *Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock* and a little bit from Book V: *Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth*. Your reader focuses primarily on Book I and the division of labor (pp.156-165), which is great, but sadly lacks selections on capital from Book II or public finance from Book V. \n\nIt is a good idea whenever you can, to read as much of Books I^[You can skip Smith's difficult digression on silver in Chapter 11.] and II as you can. You can find all of *The Wealth of Nations* online for free here:\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Wealth of Nations (Online)](https://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n### Required Readings:\n\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations*: Books I-II excerpts in *Reader* (pp.156-165)\n\n###  If You Hadn't Yet:\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Ch.4 \"Adam Smith\" in Landreth & Colander\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Ch.2 \"Adam Smith\" in Blaug\n\n\nLastly, note the following useful tidbit, although he does use both words occasionally, “stock” is Adam Smith's word for “capital.”\n\n### Recommended Readings:\n\nThe following Wikipedia entries can also provide more background:\n\n- [<i class=\"fab fa-wikipedia-w\"></i> Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith)\n- [<i class=\"fab fa-wikipedia-w\"></i> The Wealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations)\n\n### Questions to Help Your Reading\n\n#### Book I\n\n- What is/are the “wealth of nations”?\n- What is the division of labor? What limits or augments it?\n- Explain Adam Smith's famous pin factory example, and his woolen coat example.\n- What three reasons does Smith give for why dividing our labor makes us more productive?\n- Are our differences in talents a *cause* or a *consequence* of the division of labor? (Smith's philosopher and the porter example.)\n- Why and how did we discover the division of labor? Was it a conscious choice?\n- What is the difference between “real” and “nominal” price?\n- What are the “component parts” of the price of commodities?\n  - What differs between “rude” vs. “civilized” societies, and how does value & prices differ?\n- What is the “natural price” vs. the “market price”?\n- How are wages, profits, and rent determined?\n\n#### Book II\n\n- How does the division of labor depend on capital accumulation?\n- What does Adam Smith view as “productive” vs. “unproductive” labor?
