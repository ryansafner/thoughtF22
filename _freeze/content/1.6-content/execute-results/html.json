Thomas Hobbes is often invoked as the first explicit originator of the a social contract theory of the State. Writing during the English Civil War - the ultimate result of which would set the Western world on a path towards liberal democracy, constitutional republics, and the industrial revolution - Hobbes is famous for his bleak view of the state of nature (a hypothetical society without government). He is often noted as a supporter of a strong State, whom he saw as an absolute monarch, as the solution to this problem. Hobbes is often written off quickly in political philosophy, as a predecessor to the more celebrated John Locke, the clear inspiration fo the U.S. Declaration of Independence and many modern ideas. However, Hobbes provides both deep analytical insight to the nature of the problem (which can be recast in modern game theory terms), as well as a clear break from Ancient political philosophy. We will read selections from Hobbes’ famous 1651 book, Leviathan. \n\nThe famous counterweight/improvement to Hobbes’ 1651 *Leviathan* is John Locke’s 1689 *Second Treatise on Government.* Both Locke and Hobbes consider the State as a social contract rational individuals construct to escape the state of nature. In contrast to Hobbes, Locke sees humanity as far more sociable in the state of nature, able to make cooperative agreements, discover, and apply “the laws of nature.” Yet, creating a civil government improves on what he sees as the three “inconveniences” of anarchy. Most importantly, Locke famously arguers that the ultimate aim of the State is to protect individual property rights.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n### Required Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> John Locke & his writings in *Reader*\n- [<i class=\"fas fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Hobbes (1651) - Selections from *Leviathan*](https://publics22.classes.ryansafner.com/readings/Hobbes-1651.pdf)\n\n#### If You Hadn't Yet\n\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Ch.3 Early Preclassical Economic Thought up through Physiocracy (p.56) in Landreth & Colander\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Ch.1 Pre-Adamite Economics up through Physiocracy (p.24) in Blaug\n\n### Recommended Readings:\n\nAs a historical aside: Here's a good clip setting the tension between King and Parliament at the start of the Civil Wars.
