Markets and a market-based economy have lots of problems but we know the optimal results they can achieve. So, since economists have discovered the optimal conditions for resource allocation, why can't the government just replace the market to efficiently allocate resources? It will achieve the same results as a market equilibrium, and arguably for the better, since it can avoid the problems with markets!\n\nThis claim, coupled with the fact that in the late 1910s a major European power undergoes a revolution where the victors *try to establish* a socialist society, constitutes the focus of the \"socialist calculation debate.\" How would a socialist economy and society actually operate? Is it superior to market-based economy and society?\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n### Required Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Ch.14 \"The Development of Modern Microeconomic Theory\" in Landreth & Colander\n\n### Recommended Readings:\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Buchanan (1964), \"What Should Economists Do\"](/files/readings/Buchanan-1964.pdf)\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Boulding (1971), \"After Samuelson, Who Needs Adam Smith?\"](/files/readings/Boulding-1971.pdf)\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Boettke (1997), \"Where Did Economics Go Wrong: Modern Economics as a Flight from Reality, \"](/files/readings/Boettke-1997.pdf)\n\n### Questions to Help Your Reading\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
