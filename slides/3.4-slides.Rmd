- A momentous figure in the history of economic thought

  - along with Walras and the general equilibrium theorists
  - a term coined by its critics, Thorstein Veblen

- Synthesized classical and marginalist economics

- An academic, trained in mathematics
  - sought to transform Ricardo & Mill into mathematics

- Guided by deep humanitarian need to improve the lives of the poor

- Became professor of political economy at Cambridge
  - forged a generation of new students: Pigou, Keynes, Edgeworth, etc.

- Biggest goal was to make economics a separate & well-known discipline, accessible to the public and the business world
  - influenced his methodology and his (lack of) policy positions
  - synthesized many schools of thought; tried to please everyone, which led to attacks on all sides
  - endless questions about “what he really meant”

- Very patient, thoughtful thinker and writer

- Supposedly discovered marginalism in 1860s, but tested and refined it with his students, didn’t publish until 1890

> [Keynes on marginalist revolution]: “Jevons saw the kettle boil and cried out with the delighted voice of a child; Marshall too had seen the kettle boil and sat down silently to build an engine.”

- His *Principles of Economics* went through 8 editions, and was the most popular economics textbook until Paul Samuelson’s in 1948

  - Castigated Ricardo for his failure to improve the lot of the working classes

> “But I know I had a growing feeling in the later years of my work at the subject that a good mathematical theorem dealing with economic hypotheses was very unlikely to be good economics: and I went more and more on the rules—(1) Use mathematics as a shorthand language, rather than as an engine of inquiry. (2) Keep to them until you have done. (3) Translate into English. (4) Then illustrate by examples that are important in real life. (5) Burn the mathematics. (6) If you can’t succeed in (4), burn (3).

- Marshall famously kept mathematics to a minimum (in the appendices), focused on teachable graphs

- His definitions & concepts are not very precise or tidy, but *practical*

- Again, goal of appealing to businesspeople and the educated public, not technical specialists

- Instead of the sharp Classical division of land vs. labor vs. capital, Marshall: .hi[“the factors of production”]

- For theory of the firm, “we shall have to study the expenses of a .hi[representative producer]”
  - not a statistical average, but a realistically-surveyed firm of normal ability and access to technology

> “[In terms of long run equilibrium,] nothing of this is true in the world in which we live. Here every economic force is constantly changing its action, under the influence of other forces which are acting around it. Here changes in the volume of production, in its method, and its cost are ever mutually modifying one another; they are always affecting and being affected by the character and the extent of demand. Further all these mutual influences take time to work themselves out, and, as a rule, no two influences move at an equal pace. In this world therefore every plain and simple doctrine as to the relations between costs of production, demand and value is necessarily false: and the greater the appearance of lucidity which is given to it by skillful exposition, the more mischievous it is. A man is likely to be a better economist if he trusts to his common sense, and practical instincts, than if he professes to study the theory of value and is resolved to find it easy.”

- It’s futile to argue whether demand or supply determines the price:

> “We might as reasonably dispute whether it is the upper or under blade of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece of paper, as whether value is governed by utility or costs of production. It is true that when one blade is held still, and the cutting is effected by moving the other, we may say with careless brevity that the cutting is done by the second; but the statement is not strictly accurate, and is to be excused only so long as it claims to be merely a popular and not a strictly scientific account of what happens.”

- Demand, supply, and price are all interrelated and simultaneously determined

- Cournot was the first to draw demand curves on a graph
  - He used prices as the independent variable, and quantity as the dependent variable

  - Price adjusts in response to quantity

- For better or worse (debatable!), we’ve used Marshall’s version ever since

- Most important task: explain shape of demand curves: .hi[law of demand]

> “The amount demanded increases with a fall in price, and dminishes with a rise in price.”

- Diminishing marginal utility (Gossen’s first law) $\implies$ downward sloping demand

- Optimum condition for maximizing utility: equalize marginal utility of the last dollar spent on each good
  - Gossen’s second law/equimarginal principle:
  - Marshall: equates to the .hi-purple[marginal utility of money], $MU_m$
  
$$\frac{MU_a}{p_a} = \frac{MU_b}{p_b} = \frac{MU_c}{p_c} = MU_m$$

- Marshall first defines .hi[consumers’ surplus]

> “The excess of the price which he would be willing to pay rather than go without the thing, over which he actually does pay”

$$MU_a = p_a \times MU_m$$

- Implies that $p_a = \frac{MU_a}{MU_m}$: price directly can measure marginal utility

- Consumers willing to pay more for earlier-consumed units of a good than for later-consumed units
  - But consumers are able to buy all the units they want at one price in the market
  - Gain from inframarginal units (paid less than what they would be willing to pay): surplus or “rent” to consumers

- $k$ is “desired” average level of nominal money balances $\frac{M}{Py}$ in long run
  - i.e. I hold “k%” of my (nominal) income as cash each period

- Depends on:
  - convenience of holding money
  - opportunity cost (other interest-earning investments)
  - money substitutes (checks, credit, etc)
  - inflation expectations
  - degree of business confidence

- This is what Marshall really meant by his “marginal utility of money” $MU_m$

  - $V=$ *actual* $\frac{Py}{M}$

- Marshall (and Cambridge approach) alternatively uses $k$
  - “Desired ratio of money balances to income”determined by *real* factors
  - Determined by *real* factors (independent of $M)$
  - $k=$ *desired* $\frac{Py}{M}$

> “The fact is that in every state of society there is some fraction of their income which people find it worth while to keep in the form of currency, it may be a fifth, or a tenth, or a twentieth. A large command of resources in the form of currency renders their business easy and smooth, and puts them at an advantage in bargaining; but, on the other hand, it locks up in a barren form resources that might yield an income of gratification if invested, say, in extra furniture; or a money income, if invested in extra machinery or cattle.”

> “[I]f everything else remains the same, then there is this direct relationship between the volume of currency and the level of prices...Of course, the less the proportion of their resources which peopel care to keep in the form of currency, the lower will be the aggregate value of the currency, that is, the higher will prices be with a given volume of the currency.”

- Vertical axis is purchasing power of money (classicals: ‘value of money’), inversely related to price level $P$
  - How many goods can be bought with $1

- Nominal demand for money, $M^{D}=kPy$, so *real* demand $\left(\frac{M^D}{P}\right)$ is constant for given $y$ $\implies$ demand curve is a rectangular hyperbola

- A doubling of $M$ yields exactly double prices $P$ and exactly cuts purchasing power of money, $\frac{1}{P}$ in $\frac{1}{2}$
