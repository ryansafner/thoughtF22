&gt; “If the interests of the landlord be of sufficient consequence, to determine us not to avail ourselves of all the benefits which would follow from importing corn at a cheap price, they should also influence us in rejecting all improvements in agriculture, and in the implements of husbandry; for it is as certain that corn is rendered cheap, rents are lowered, and the ability of the landlord to pay taxes, is for a time, at least, as much impaired by such improvements, as by the importation of corn. To be consistent then, let us by the same act arrest improvement, and prohibit importation.”

&gt; “To produce the wine in Portugal, might require only the labour of 80 men for one year, and to produce the cloth in the same country, might require the labour of 90 men for the same time. It would therefore be advantageous for her to export wine in exchange for cloth. This exchange might even take place, notwithstanding that the commodity imported by Portugal could be produced there with less labour than in England. Though she could make the cloth with the labour of 90 men, she would import it from a country where it required the labour of 100 men to produce it, because it would be advantageous to her rather to employ her capital in the production of wine, for which she would obtain more cloth from England, than she could produce by diverting a portion of her capital from the cultivation of vines to the manufacture of cloth.”

Second, it would relieve the Condition of England question by cheapening the price of food and ensuring more regular employment. Third, it would make English agriculture more efficient by stimulating demand for its products in urban and industrial areas. Fourth, it would introduce through mutually advantageous international trade a new era of international fellowship and peace.

  - goods with fixed supply (Rembrandt paintings, etc.)
  - paper money
  - monopolized products

  - Fixed coefficients in production

- Assumption of fixed coefficients in production

`$$q=\min(l,k)$$`
  - a Leontief production function
  - i.e. perfect complements

- Labor and capital must be combined in a fixed proportion, a constant `\(\frac{L}{K}\)` ratio

- Ex: 1 worker and 1 shovel can produce 1 bushel of corn

- Ricardo will talk about adding constant .hi-turquoise[“doses” of labor &amp; capital] (combined)

- “Rent” to landowner in everyday language is not precise!
  - Contains both elements of “profits” and “rents” (payment for land improvements)

&gt; “If, then, good land existed in quantity much more abundant than the production of food for an increasing population required, or if capital could be indefinitely employed without a diminished return on the old land, there could be no rise of rent; for rent invariably proceeds from the employment of an additional quantity of labour with a proportionally less return.”

- Example adapted from Blaug (1996)

- Let price of corn be $1/bushel
  - so marginal physical product = marginal revenue product (just add a $ in front)

- Let price of one homogenous unit of K+L (“man-with-shovel”) be $100

- Assume each farmer (A, B, C) will apply a K+L dose so long as `\(MR&gt;MC\)`

- In Ricardian theory, the .hi-purple[fixed factor of production] (land) earns all inframarginal residuals, i.e. gets paid rent
  - variable factors are paid their marginal products 

- Ricardo assumed .hi-purple[land is fixed, and has no opportunity cost]
  - Assumes “land” in general, rather than modern assumption: *land for specific uses* (which would have opportunity costs)!
  - That is why the extensive margin of land earns *no rent* (has no alternative use)

- When people use the term “rent” in ordinary language, they mean “contract rent” (what you pay your landlord)
  - this constitutes multiple things: profit, payment for their improvements to land, and pure (Ricardian) rents

- .hi-purple[Ricardian rents] or .hi-purple[Scarcity rents]: Ricardo’s careful definition of rent “the use of the original and indestructible powers of the soil”
  - i.e. permission for using something that already exists (and the landlord did not *produce*)!
  - only exists because of a fixed supply (of land)

- Can apply .hi-purple[Ricardian Rents] to *anything* in scarce supply:
  - talent, intellectual property, monopoly!
