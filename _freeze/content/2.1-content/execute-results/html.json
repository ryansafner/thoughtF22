(Your textbooks seem to disagree!)\n- What do Hume and Smith mean by \"sentiments?\"\n- How does Hume approach money? In what ways is his quantity theory of money similar to, and different from, John Locke's?\n- What is Hume's \"price-specie flow mechanism\"? How does this connect with a gold standard (or similar commodity-based money)?\n- How does Hume criticize mercantilism?\n- According to Hume, where does interest come from, and how are interest rates determined? Is it based on the money supply, as some mercantilists supposed?\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
