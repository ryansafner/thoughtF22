How is this tied in with uncertainty, and with profit?\n\n#### On Interest\n\n- What are Böhm-Bawerk’s three reasons for a positive rate of interest?\n- What is “roundaboutness” in production? Why is it more productive, according to Böhm-Bawerk?\n- What is “time preference”?\n- How does Fisher conceive of interest as it relates to income, and capitalized values? \n- What is the quantity theory of money, and Fisher’s equation of exchange? What are the main takeaways?\n- What is the difference between the “natural rate” and the “market rate” of interest, according to Wicksell? Explain Wicksell’s “cumulative process” that results if the two are different.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
