We also explore Smith and the Classicals' opposition to mercantilism and Smith's account of how Europe escaped feudalism.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n### Required Readings:\n\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations*: Book IV excerpts in *Reader* (pp.165-179)\n\n### If You Hadn't Yet:\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Ch.4 \"Adam Smith\" in Landreth & Colander\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Ch.2 \"Adam Smith\" in Blaug\n\nThough he is admittedly long-winded and lapses between theoretical statements, historical examples, and analogies or current events from the 18^th^ century, Adam Smith is quite easy and entertaining to read. Any educated person should read Smith, and, if you are interested in economics, **you should read as much Smith as you can get your hands on.** *Everything* is there (in some form).\n\nToday we will focus primarily on understanding the system of the Classical Economics (so a bit of foreshadowing), as well as Smith's refutation of mercantilism and physiocracy. As such, in addition to Smith, I will be quoting from Hume and Bastiat regarding their views on mercantilism (see recommended readings below). The quotes from Hume we have already seen. \n\nThe reading for Smith comes primarily from *Book IV: Of the Systems of Political Oeconomy.* These sections are in your *Reader* (p.165-179). I will also be quoting form *Book III* when describing the emergence of commercial society out of feudal society. You can find all of *The Wealth of Nations* online for free here: \n\n- [<i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Wealth of Nations (Online)](https://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html)\n\nNext class we will dive into more of Smith's analytical insights and the analysis of markets, prices, and economic growth. See the associated readings from *WON* [for next class](/reading/2.3-reading).\n\n### Recommended Readings:\n\nWeingast discusses Adam Smith's Book III on the economic history of Europe in the context of his views on economic development:\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fas file-pdf\"></i> Weingast (2016) - “Adam Smith's Theory of Violence and the Political-Economics of Development”](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2881042)\n\nBelow are the readings from Bastiat that I quote. I also make everyone in ECON 306 read (or at least I discuss) Bastiat's broken window parable in “What is Seen and Not Seen”\n\n- [<i class=\"fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> Bastiat (1845) “The Candlemakers Petition”](http://bastiat.org/en/petition.html)\n- [<i class=\"fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> Bastiat (1850) “The Balance of Trade”](https://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss.html?chapter_num=16#book-reader)\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> Bastiat, 1848 [“What is Seen and Not Seen”](https://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss.html?chapter_num=4#book-reader), (Section 1)\n\nAs I mentioned in class, you might find [How the Dismal Science Got its Name](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal.html) insightful and surprising. It is a 6 part series of blog posts based on research by David Levy & Sandra Peart.\n- [Part I](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal.html)\n- [Part II](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal2.html)\n- [Part III](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal3.html)\n- [Part IV](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal4.html)\n- [Part V](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal5.html)\n- [Part VI](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal6.html)\n\nThe following Wikipedia entries can also provide more background on these writers and their famous works:\n\n- [<i class=\"fab fa-wikipedia-w\"></i> Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith)\n- [<i class=\"fab fa-wikipedia-w\"></i> The Wealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations)\n\n\n### Questions to Help Your Reading\n\nBook III\n\n- How did Europe escape feudalism and emerge a “commercial society”?\n\nBook IV\n\n- What does Smith say about the goal of mercantilism?\n- What does Smith say is the goal of all economic activity?\n- What does Smith say about the “balance of trade” doctrine?\n- What does Smith think of Quesnay and the physiocrats?\n- What is the “obvious and simple system of natural liberty?” What duties does Smith believe the government has?\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
