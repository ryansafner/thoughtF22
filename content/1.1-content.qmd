## <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

Welcome to ECON 480 --- Econometrics! Today's lesson will be an overview of the content and the assignments of the course. Please read and familiarize yourself with the [syllabus](/syllabus).

This is not just a "syllabus day," as we need to hit the ground running, beginning with learning the software we will be using this semester. Starting next class, we will do a deep dive in to R for about 2 weeks. In preparation, please do the following **before next class**:

1.  Go to [RStudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and register a (free) account with your Hood details.

2.  Try to [install R and R Studio](https://metricsf22.classes.ryansafner.com/reference/#installing-r-and-r-studio) on your computer if you are able, before next class. You will still always have RStudio.cloud available all to use in your browser, but it is much better to have a real version of `R` and `R Studio` on your own machine to work with all semester.

Please note going forward, the lesson numbers and topics (e.g. 1.1) on this website are *my* design, and will not match up with the textbook!

## <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Slides

Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. Note while in going through the slides, you can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.

The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!
