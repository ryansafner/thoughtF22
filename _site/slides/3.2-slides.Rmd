- What role do costs of production (payments to factors) play in value of final goods?

- Costs are the values which are forgone in directing resources to a particular production process rather than other production processes

- In this sense, production costs are really a reflection of utilities elsewhere in the economy

- Beginnings of major disagreements:

- Jevons always thought costs were “real” in some sense, e.g. the *disutility* or pain of labor
  - utility of consumption vs. disutility of production; utility & disutility curves

- Marshall & Edgeworth would later argue you can derive an upward-sloping supply/cost curve for non-land factors by disutility of use

- Menger had clear insights about capital and production: goods of higher order, their complementarity and substitutability, etc.

- If we all agree that prices of final goods reflect their marginal utility, how do we price factor services (land, labor, capital)?

- Wieser, using a legal term, this is a .hi-purple[“problem of imputation”]

- Wieser’s solution was .hi-purple[linear programming] with simultaneous equations (no calculus)

- .hi-green[Example]: consider a three-good society, factors in each good’s production are $x$, $y$, and $z$, represented by three simultaneous equations:

$$\begin{align*}
x+y&=100\\
2x+3z&=290\\
4y+5z&=590\\
\end{align*}$$

- Solve for $x$, $y$, and $z$ (prices of each factor)

- Assumes prices for final goods are given, fixed production coefficients, and no substitution of factors

- Took a different approach to the imputation problem (factor pricing) than Wieser:

- Followed a phrase in Menger, “the loss principle” — applying to the price of the final good what would be lost if one of the factor services is withdrawn

> “If in any branch of production the price sinks below the cost...men will withdraw from that branch and engage in some better paying branch of production. Conversely, if in one branch of production, the market price of the finished good is considerably higher than the value of the sacrificed or expended means of production, then will men be drawn from less profitable industries. They will press into the better paying branch of production, until through the increased supply, the price is again forced down to cost.

> “What determine the amount of this cost? .hi[The amount of the cost] is identical with the value of the productive power, and, as a rule, is determined by the money marginal utility of this productive power...The price of a definite specie of freely reproducible goods fixes itself in the long run at that point where the money marginal utility, for those who desire to purchase these products, .hi[intersects the money marginal utility of all those who desire to purchase in the other communicating branches of production.] The figure of the two blade of a pair of shears still holds good. One of the two blade, whose coming together determine the height of the price of any species of product, is in truth the marginal utility of this particular product. The other, which we are wont to call .hi["cost," is the marginal utility of the products of other communicating branches of production.] Or, according to Wieser, the marginal utility of "production related goods." .hi[It is, therefore, utility and not disutility which, as well on the side of supply as of demand, determine the height of the price.] This, too, even where the so-called law of cost plays its role in giving value to goods. .hi[Jevons, therefore, did not exaggerate the importance of the one side, but came very near the truth when he said "value depends entirely upon utility.”] (45)

$$\frac{MP_l}{p_l}  =  \frac{MP_k}{p_k} = \frac{MP_t}{p_t} = \cdots = \frac{MP_n}{p_n}$$

- Cost of production is minimized where the **marginal product per dollar spent** is **equalized** across all $n$ possible inputs

- A British economist and unitarian minister

- Learned economics from Jevons, and got inspired to write about political economy after reading Henry George

- 1894, *An Essay on the Co-Ordination of the Laws of Distribution*
  - tries to solve the product exhaustion problem of marginal productivity theory

- 1910, *The Common Sense of Political Economy: Including a Study of the Human Basis of Economic Law*
  - one of the greatest books popularizing marginalism

- Uses Euler’s Theorem of homogeneous functions to **prove** product exhaustion under specific conditions:
  - production functions must be linearly homogenous (of degree 1)

$$c^{n}Y =f(c^{n}L,c^{n}K,c^{n}T): n=1$$
  - we would say: .hi-purple[“constant returns to scale”]

# Misconceptions About Marginal Productivity Theory

1. Mistaken interpretation that MPT says factor prices are *determined* by their marginal products
  - i.e. wage is determined by $MP_L$
  - A lot of Clark’s tone seems to imply this

--

- In truth, MPT says the *opposite!*: the quantity of factors employed (and thus their $MP$'s) depends on factor prices!
  - Factor prices are determined by supply & demand, period.

--

- MPT is a description of factor markets *in equilibrium*: factors are paid their marginal products
  - In essence, factor payments are a *measure* of $MP$ in equilibrium

> “This [marginal productivity] doctrine has sometimes been put forward as a theory of wages. But there is no valid ground for any such pretension. The doctrine that the earnings of a worker tend to be equal to the net product of his work, has by itself no real meaning; since in order to estimate net product, we have to take for granted all the expenses of production of the commodity on which he works, other than his own wages. But though this objection is valid against a claim that it contains a theory of wages; it is not valid against a claim that the doctrine throws into clear light the action of one of the causes that govern wages,” (p.429-30).

> “If each productive function is paid for according to the amount of its product, then each man get what he himself produces. If he works, he gets what he creates by working; if he provides capital, he gets what his capital produces; and if, further, he renders service by coordinating labor and capital, he gets the product that can be separately traced to that function. Only in one of these ways can a man produce anything. If he receives all that he brings into existence through any one of these three functions, he receives all that he creates at all,” (p.7)

- It sounds like Clark is referring to **each individual** worker (including the **_infra_**marginal workers!) being paid their marginal product

- But this is only true for the *marginal* workers — they “set” the equilibrium wage for *all* equivalent workers

- Recall .hi-red[market supply] is the minimum willingness of factor owners to accept, the minimum price necessary to bring a resource to market

- *Inframarginal* workers earn surplus (.red[rents]): difference between equilibrium wage and minimum WTA
