Buchanan, 1964, \"What Should Economists Do?\"]{style=\"float:right\"}\n\n<br>\n\n[The History of Economic Thought]{.newthought} explores the development of economic principles and tools and the major economic thinkers to explain why the discipline and practice of economics looks the way it does today. By studying principles and intermediate micro- and macro-economics, you may get the impression that economics is a complete system of agreed-upon scientific laws to be applied individuals or the economy for understanding and recommending policy. This course will strip away that belief and get you to see that what is accepted as mainstream economics both has evolved considerably over the past 250 years and continues to be contested to this day. While there is much consensus, there continues to be much debate as to what economics *is*, what it is *about*, what are the best *methods* to study it, what are the *policy implications*, and what *does it tell us* about the world. The best way to understand these debates and to take a position is to understand the history of economic thought: how ideas of various thinkers and schools of thought were slowly incorporated into the mainstream of economics, marginalized as heterodox, or completely discarded; and how this process has changed many times.\n\nWe will read famous texts by the major thinkers - Smith, Ricardo, Malthus, Marx, Mill, Keynes - explore the key insights and development of concepts and models from different schools of thought - mercantilist, classical, Marxist, neoclassical, Austrian, institutional, Keynesian, New- and Post-Keynesian, etc - and place developments and ideas into historical context. As a one-semester course, we must inevitably leave out many major thinkers, ideas, and debates in the history of economic thought. If you have a particular interest that we do not cover, consider this an ideal topic for a research paper.\n\nMuch of this course will examine the history of how modern economic doctrine evolved, and this assumes that you have familiarity with modern economic theory at the intermediate level. As such, the **prerequisites** for this course are **ECON 305 - Macroeconomic Analysis** *and* **ECON 306 - Microeconomic Analysis**.\n\nAs a **400-level course** required for all economics majors, this course is intended to be an upper-level seminar to enrich your understanding of economics beyond the theoretical tools you have already learned. **This implies a significant amount of reading, writing, and discussing, on your part, requiring you to take ownership of your own learning.** Against my strong instincts to lecture, this class will primarily be discussion-based and focused heavily on required readings for each meeting. \n\n# Course objectives\n\n<span class=\"newthought\">By the end of this course,</span> you will:\n\n- Identify key economic writers and their contributions to economic thought\n- Discuss the influence and value of different writers and their contributions\n- Identify and distinguish the major schools of economic thought: Classical, Marxist, Neoclassical, Austrian, Keynesian, Monetarist, New Classical\n- Place theories and ideas studied within the context of the time\n- Better comprehend the origins and context of orthodox economic theory today\n- Explore critiques of orthodox economic theory from various heterodox schools of thought and understand contested areas\n- Reflect on the nature of economics as a discipline\n- Understand the origins of key economic concepts and models\n- Trace the evolution of major ideas through time, via your own writing\n\nGiven these objectives, this course fulfills two of the learning outcomes for [the George B. Delaplaine, Jr. School of Business](https://www.hood.edu/academics/departments/george-b-delaplaine-jr-school-business/student-learning-outcomes) Economics B.A. program:\n\n- Apply economic reasoning and models to understand and analyze problems of public policy [...]\n- Demonstrate effective oral and written communications skills for personal and professional success[...]\n\n<span class=\"newthought\">My standard disclaimer:</span> This class may challenge many of your existing beliefs and conceptions about how the world works, and how it should work. This is the most important and exciting part of a liberal arts education. This does *not* mean that I want to make you to see everything \"my way.\" In fact, if you come out of this class thinking exactly like me, then I have probably failed you as a teacher. To the best of my ability, I keep my opinions to myself unless relevant for purposes of discussion, and I respect and invite you to reach your own conclusions on all matters. \n\nIf at any point you find yourself struggling in this course for any reason, please come see me. Do not suffer in silence! Coming to see me for help does not diminish my view of you, in fact I will hold you in *higher* regard for understanding your own needs and taking charge of your own learning. There are also a some fantastic resources on campus, such as the [Center for Academic Achievement and Retention (CAAR)](http://www.hood.edu/campus-services/academic-services/index.html) and the [Beneficial-Hodson Library](http://www.hood.edu/library/). \n\nSee my [tips for success in this course](/resources). \n\n# Required Course materials \n\nThis course requires regular online internet access. If you know you will be unable to access the internet regularly, please let me know and we can make arrangements.\n\nYou can find all course materials at my **dedicated website** for this course: [thoughtF21.classes.ryansafner.com](https://thoughtF21.classes.ryansafner.com). Links to the website are posted on our Blackboard course page. Please familiarize yourself with the website, see that it contains this [syllabus](https://thoughtF21.classes.ryansafner.com/syllabus/), [resources](https://thoughtF21.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/) to help you, and our [schedule](https://thoughtF21.classes.ryansafner.com/schedule/). On the schedule page, you can find each module with its own class page (**start there!**) along with all related readings, lecture slides, practice problems, and assignments.\n\nMy lecture slides will be shared with you, but you also have required books necessary for completing assignments.\n\n## Books {-}\n\nOur readings are of two types: (1) *primary sources* - the famous texts of the writers themselves; and (2) a *secondary textbook* that will help you interpret the primary sources and place them in the broader context of their day and in the evolution of economic thought.\n\n**Primary Sources:**\n\n1. Medema, Steven G and Warren J Samuels, eds., 2013,  *The History of Economic Thought: A Reader*, 2^nd^ ed., New York: Routledge\n\n**Secondary Textbook**:\n\nYou must purchase a secondary textbook, but I will give you an option to choose one. I will be drawing from both books in my lectures. \n\n2. Landreth, Harry and David C Colander, 2002, [*History of Economic Thought*](https://www.amazon.com/History-Economic-Thought-Harry-Landreth/dp/0618133941), 4^th^ ed., Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company\n\n3. Blaug, Mark, 1996, *Economic Theory in Retrospect*, 5^th^ ed., New York: Cambridge University Press\n\nI intended on requiring Landreth and Colander (2002), but I was sad to find that it is out of print. As such, I was unable to get it via Hood's bookstore. There should be used copies on Amazon for a somewhat reasonable price (it has been fluctuating between $20-$100). *I strongly recommend this book* because it is easier to read, focuses more on historical context and big ideas than getting lost in the math/models, and has more robust coverage of different schools of thought (including heterodox) and extends right up to the present day.\n\nBlaug (1996) is also an excellent book, but is a bit more advanced, focusing on fewer thinkers, and focusing in detail on their contributions to modern economic *theory* (i.e. models and math) with very little discussion of historical context. I would say get Blaug only if you are unable to get Landreth and Colander for a reasonable price (or at all). \n\n*Do not purchase both books!*\n\n# Assignments and Grades\n\nYour final course grade is the weighted average of the following assignments. You can find general descriptions for all the assignments on the [assignments page](assignments/) and more specific information (such as due dates) and examples on each assignment's page on the [schedule page](schedule/).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Frequency </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Assignment </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Weight </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> n </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Participation (Average) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 35% </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Term Paper </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 35% </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Short Papers </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 20% </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> n </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Tournament Votes </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 10% </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n\n\n\n\nEach assignment is graded on a 100 point scale. Letter-grade equivalents are based on the following scale:\n\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Grade </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Range </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Grade </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Range </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 93–100% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> C </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 73–76% </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A− </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 90–92% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> C− </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 70–72% </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> B+ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 87–89% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> D+ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 67–69% </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> B </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 83–86% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> D </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 63–66% </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> B− </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 80–82% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> D− </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 60–62% </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> C+ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 77–79% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> F </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> &lt; 60% </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n\n\nSee also my [<i class=\"fas fa-calculator\"></i> `Grade Calculator`](https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/452_grade_calculator/) app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast \"what if\" scenarios.\n\nThese grades are firm cutoffs, but I do of course round upwards $(\\geq$ 0.5) for final grades. A necessary reminder, as an academic, I am not in the business of *giving* out grades, I merely report the grade that you *earn*. I will not alter your grade unless you provide a reasonable argument that I am in error (which does happen from time to time). \n\n**No extra credit is available**\n\n# Policies and Expectations \n\nThis syllabus is a contract between you, the student, and me, your instructor. It has been carefully and deliberately thought out. (A syllabus can and will be used as a legal document for disputes tried at a court of law. Ask me how I know.), and I will uphold my end of the agreement and expect you to uphold yours. \n\nIn the language of game theory, this syllabus is my commitment device. I am a very understanding person, and I know that exceptions to rules often need to be made for students. However, to be *fair* to *all* students the syllabus artificially constrains my ability to make exceptions at a whim for anyone. This prevents clever students from exploiting my congenial personality at everyone else's expense. Please read and familiarize yourself with the course policies and expectations of you. Chances are, if you have a question, it is answered herein.\n\n<!--This is a hybrid course with synchronous (live) and asynchronous (on your own time) parts. \n\nYou are generally expected to join (online via Zoom) our **synchronous** class sessions unless circumstances prevent you from doing so. Day-to-day attendance is not graded per se, but I strongly recommend you join in all live sessions in which you are able, since we all can provide live feedback and I can answer questions and address concerns as soon as they come up. You will also benefit from a rigid schedule and shared community. \n\nIf you are unable to make a particular class, you generally do not need to let me know. **The videos from all class sessions are posted on Blackboard** so please review videos of classes you were unable to attend live. \n\nAll assignmnents are able to be completed **asynchronously** during the week, and are **generally due by 11:59PM Sunday each week** to allow you flexibility in your hectic schedules.-->\n\n## Attendence\n\nYour day-to-day classroom attendance is not graded. My philosophy is that you are all adults and must take ownership of your own learning or else you will not succeed. Some assignments may require in-class participation for credit, and an (unexcused) absence may be detrimental to your grade. Attending class is one of the strongest predictors of success.\n\nHowever, as required under Hood College's “Promise of Fall Plan,” (Ch. 2-C) **your classroom attendance will be recorded at every class meeting.** This is primarily to facilitate contact tracing. \n\nIf you know you will be absent, you are not *required* to let me know, but it is polite to give notice (Note if I do not reply to an email of yours letting me know, I am probably busy but will still see it and appreciate your email). Your absence will be noted and recorded for the purposes stated above. If, however, we have an assignment due in class, you *must* notify me ahead of time in order to make alternate arrangements to still receive credit. Hasty ex-post attempts to notify me will generate little sympathy. \n\n## Late Assignments \n\nI will accept late assignments, but will subtract a specified amount of points as a penalty. Even if it is the last week of the semester, I encourage you to turn in late work: some points are better than no points!\n\n**Homeworks**: If you turn in a homework after it is due but before it is graded or the answer key posted, I generally will not take off any points. However, **if you turn in a homework _after_ the answer key is posted, I will automatically deduct 15 points (so the maximum grade you can earn on it is an 80).**\n\n**Exams**: If you know that you will be unable to complete an *in-class exam* as scheduled for a legitimate reason, please notify me at least *one week* in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only *after* the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy.\n\n**Papers**: Starting at the deadline, I will take off 1 point for every hour that your assignment is late.\n\nI reserve the right to re-weight assignments for students whom I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment.\n\n## Grading \n\nI will try my best to post grades on Blackboard's Grading Center and return graded assignments to you within about one week of you turning them in. There will be exceptions. Where applicable, I will post answer keys once I know most homeworks are turned in (see Late Assignments above for penalties). Blackboard's Grading Center is the place to look for your most up-to-date grades. See also my [<i class=\"fas fa-calculator\"></i> `Grade Calculator`](https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/480_grade_calculator/) app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast \"what if\" scenarios.\n\n## Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours \n\nStudents must regularly monitor their **Hood email accounts** to receive important college information, including messages related to this class. Email through the Blackboard system is my main method of communicating announcements and deadlines regarding your assignments. **Please do not reply to any automated Blackboard emails - I may not recieve it!**. My Hood email (`safner@hood.edu`) is the best means of contacting me. I will do my best to respond within 24 hours. If I do not reply within 48 hours, do not take it personally, and *feel free to send a follow up email* in the very likely event that I genuinely did not see your original message.\n\nOur [slack channel](https://hoodcollegeeconomics.slack.com) is available to all students and faculty in Economics and Business. I have invited all of my classes and advisees. It will not be extended to non-Business/Economics students or faculty. All users must use their **hood emails** and **true first and last names**. Each course has its own channel, exclusive for verified students in the course, and myself, by my invite only. As a third party platform, you agree to its Terms of Service. I have created this space as a way to stay connected, to help one another, and to foster community. Behaviors such as posting inappropriate content, harassing others, or engaging in academic dishonesty, to be determined solely at my discretion, will result in one warning, the content will be deleted, and subsequent behavior will result in a ban. \n\nIn addition to in-person office hours, you can also make an appointment for **“office hours”** on Zoom. You can join in with video, audio, and/or chat, whichever you feel comfortable with. Of course, if you are not available during those times, we can schedule our own time if you prefer this method over email or Slack. If you want to go over material from class, please have *specific* questions you want help with. I am not in the business of giving private lectures (particularly if you missed class without a valid excuse).\n\nWatch this excellent and accurate video explaining office hours:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/270014784\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Netiquette \n\nWhen using Zoom and Slack, please follow appropriate internet etiquette (\"Netiquette\"). Written communications, like blog posts or use of the Zoom chat, lacks important nonverbal cues (such as body language, tone of voice, sarcasm, etc). \n\nAbove all else, please respect one another and think/reread carefully about how others may see your post before you submit a comment. You are expected to disagree and have different opinions, this is inherently valuable in a discussion. Please be civil and constructive in responding to others' comments: writing *\"have you considered 'X'?\"* is a lot more helpful to all involved than just writing *\"well you're just wrong.\"*\n\nPosting content that is wilfully incindiary, illegal, or that constitutes academic dishonesty (such as plagarism) will automatically earn a grade of 0 and may be elevated to other authorities on campus.\n\nWhen using the chat function on Zoom or public Slack channels, please treat it as official course communications, even though I may not be grading it. It may be a quick and informal tool - don't feel you need to worry about spelling or perfect grammar - but please try to avoid *too* informal \"text-speak\" (i.e. say \"That's good for you\" instead of \"thas good 4 u\").\n\n## Privacy \n\n[Maryland law](https://www.execvision.io/blog/maryland-call-recording-laws/) [requires](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2005/gcj/10-402.html) all parties consent for a conversation or meeting to be recorded. If you join in, and certainly if you participate, **you are consenting to be recorded.** However, as described below, videos are *not accessible* beyond our class.\n\nLive lectures are recorded on Zoom and posted to Blackboard via Panopto, a secure course management system for video. Among other nice features (such as multiple video screens, close captioning, and time-stamped search functions!), Panopto is authenticated via your Blackboard credentials, ensuring that *our course videos are not accessible to the open internet.*\n\n<!--Scheduled discussions, in which there is no lecture by me, will *never* be recorded or posted online.-->\n\nFor the privacy of your peers, and to foster an environment of trust and academic freedom to explore ideas, **do not record our course lectures or discussions.** You are already getting my official copies.\n\nThe [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) prevents me from disclosing or discussing any student information, including grades and records about student performance. If the student is at least 18 years of age, *parents (or spouses) do not have a right to obtain this information*, except with consent by the student.\n\nMany of you may be tuning in remotely, living with parents, and may have occasional interruptions due to sharing a space. This is normal and fine, but know that I will protect your privacy and not discuss your performance when parents (or anyone other than you, for that matter) are present, without your explicit consent.\n\n## Enrollment\n\nStudents are responsible for verifying their enrollment in this class. The last day to add or drop this class with no penalty is **Wednesday, September 1**. Be aware of [important dates](https://www.hood.edu/offices-services/registrars-office/academic-calendar).\n\n## Honor Code \n\nHood College has an Academic Honor Code which requires all members of this community to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited.  All violations of the Honor Code are taken seriously, will be reported to appropriate authority, and may result in severe penalties, including expulsion from the college. See [here](http://hood.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2016-2017/Catalog/The-Spirit-of-Hood/The-Academic-Honor-Code-and-Code-of-Conduct) for more detailed information.\n\n## Van Halen and M&Ms {.unlisted}\n\nWhen you have completed reading the syllabus, email me a picture of the band Van Halen and a picture of a bowl of M&Ms. If you do this *before* the date of the first exam, you will get bonus points on the exam. If 75-100% of the class does this, you each get 2 points. If 50-75% of the class does this, you each get 4 points. If 25-50% of the class does this, you each get 6 points. If 0-25% of the class does this, you each get 8 points. Yes, you read this correctly.\n\n## Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations \n\nCollege courses can, and should, be challenging and bring you out of your comfort zone in a safe and equitable environment. If, however, you feel at any point in the semester that certain assignments or aspects of the course will be disproportionately uncomfortable or burdensome for you due to any factor beyond your control, please come see me or email me. I am a very understanding person and am happy to work out a solution together. I reserve the right to modify and reweight assignments at my sole discretion for students that I belive would legitimately be at a disadvantage, through no fault of their own, to complete them as described.\n\nIf you are unable to afford required textbooks or other resources for any reason, come see me and we can find a solution that works for you.\n\nThis course is intended to be accessible for all students, including those with mental, physical, or cognitive disabilities, illness, injuries, impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect one's equal access to education. If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your specific needs. I also encourage you to contact the [Office of Accessibility Services](https://www.hood.edu/academics/josephine-steiner-center-academic-achievement-retention/accessibility-services) (301-696-3421). If you have a diagnosis or history of accommodations in high school or previous postsecondary institutions, Accessibility Services can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through Accessibility Services, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors.\n\n# Tentative Schedule \n\n**You can find a full schedule** with much more details, including the readings, appendices, and other further resources for each class meeting on the [schedule page](schedule/).",
